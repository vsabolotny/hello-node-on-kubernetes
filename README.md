# Hello node on kubernetes
This is a very simple application written with node.js, running on docker and kubernetes, as a database we are using mongodb. 

This application is a challenge assignment in the course https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-kubernetes-the-practical-guide/ which I can highly recommend if you want to learn docker and kubernetes.

# Installation
tbd.
